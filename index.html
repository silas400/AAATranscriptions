            <p class="quote">"Piano transcriptions are wonderful because the pianist can enjoy music that is not specifically written for the piano. In PTX editions, the author's primary goal is fidelity, and keeping what the composer originally intended is very important. The liberties taken were aimed at the most pianist way of playing certain passages without altering the original essence intended by the composer. Off-key passages and primal passages both offer unique treatments and do not have to be taken literally. In the PTX edition, there are notes written that can be omitted if it serves the performance. Some of the notes written are not essential to the overall composition of the transcription. Unique approaches to the performance are encouraged, as the performer is welcome to express their individuality and imagination. Feel free to personalize your performance of the piece to make it your own. Thank you."</p>
